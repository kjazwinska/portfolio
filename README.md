This repository showcases my journey as a Junior Manual Tester, starting from my coursework on Udemy to individual training sessions with an experienced Senior Tester, followed by a 6-month internship. Here, you will find examples of my work, including test cases and scenarios, bug reports, API testing using Postman, and workflow diagrams.

## 6-Month Internship

During my 6-month internship, I gained practical experience in the field of manual testing. I was responsible for documentation management, conducting functional and performance tests, retesting, and reporting issues using Jira. Additionally, I worked extensively with Postman to test APIs and ensure their functionality and reliability. Collaboration with the development team was an integral part of my work.

## Individual Training with Senior Tester

To further enhance my skills, I underwent personalized training sessions with a seasoned Senior Tester. These sessions focused on practicing different types of testing, performing testing tasks, and addressing common challenges faced by testers during their work.

## Coursework on Udemy
Postman - REST API testing

Practical software testing course

Cypress from scratch - Test automation (during studying)

I have completed comprehensive courses on Udemy, which provided me with a solid foundation in manual testing. These courses covered various testing methodologies, techniques, and best practices.
